                        <h5>Radical SAM superfamily (RSS) and its subgroups</h5>

                        <p>
                        The RSS is arguably the largest and most functionally diverse enzyme superfamily.  As of February 2020, the RSS
                        included 571,785 sequences (InterPro families IPR007197 and IPR006638 from Release 78 of the InterPro
                        database/Release 2020_01 of the UniProt database).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The members of the radical SAM superfamily contain a Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster 
                        near the N-terminus of a (&beta;/&alpha;)<sub>6</sub>-barrel domain  
                        that binds S-adenosyl methionine (SAM);
                        one-electron reduction of the bound SAM yields a 5&prime;-deoxyadenosyl radical (5&prime;-dAdo&bull;) and Met.
                        The 5&prime;-dAdo&bull; generates a substrate radical (R&bull;) (and 5&prime;-deoxyadenosine) that undergoes intriguing and often
                        complex chemistry to yield the product.

                        The SFLD (<a target="_blank" href="http://sfld.rbvi.ucsf.edu/archive/django/index.html">http://sfld.rbvi.ucsf.edu/archive/django/index.html</a>) used
                        an SSN to segregate the RSS into 20 subgroups with characterized functions and 22 without characterized functions.  Their
                        analysis was described in Methods in Enzymology Volume 606 in 2018:
                        <i>Atlas of the Radical SAM Superfamily:  Divergent Evolution of Function Using an
                        "Plug and Play" Domain</i>, G.L. Holliday, E. Akiva, E.C. Meng, S.D. Brown, S. Calhoun, U. Pieper, A. Sali, S.J. Booker and P.C. Babbitt
                        (doi: <a target="_blank" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.mie.2018.06.004">10.1016/bs.mie.2018.06.004</a>).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        At the time of their analyses (2017), the RSS included 113,776 sequences that were collected at 50% sequence identity into 10,741 representative nodes so 
                        that the SSN could be visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape (<a target="_blank" href="https://cytoscape.org/">https://cytoscape.org/</a>).
                        The SSN is reproduced below (Figure 5 in the Atlas; minimum e-value 
                        threshold to draw edges between nodes is 20), with the characterized subgroups numbered and colored as described by the SFLD.

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        We provide a web resource with three "democratized" genomic enzymology tools 
                        (<a target="_blank" href="https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/">https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/</a>;
                        doi: <a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00735">10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00735</a>)
                        The tools are used to 1) explore sequence-function space in protein families using SSNs (generated with EFI-EST),
                        2) explore genome neighborhoods for clues about functions of uncharacterized enzymes (collected with EFI-GNT), and 
                        3) prioritize uncharacterized SSN clusters for functional assignment based on human microbiome metagenome abundance
                        (chemically guided functional profiling with EFI-CGFP).  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        However, experimentalists interested in the RSS cannot take full advantage of the tools.  First, the SSN for the RSS is too large to be visualized/analyzed 
                        with Cytoscape using computers that are typically available (too many nodes and edges).  Also, regularly updated lists of the members of the subgroups are 
                        not available for SSN generation because 1) the SFLD now is an archive and 2) many of the InterPro families for the subgroups are incomplete .
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Therefore, we developed RadicalSAM.org to provide regularly updated lists of accession IDs for the subgroups so
                        that their SSNs can generated with EFI-EST and analyzed with Cytoscape.  The SSNs can used as input for the
                        EFI-GNT and EFI-CGFP tools.  In almost all cases (except SFLD subgroup 5, B12-binding domain and SFLD subgroup 17,
                        SPASM/Twitch domain; vide infra), the number of UniRef50 IDs in a subgroup is sufficiently small that the SSNs can
                        be visualized with Cytoscape using typically available computers.  RadicalSAM.org also provides descriptive
                        information for the subgroups to aid target selection and inference of function,
                        e.g., multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), WebLogos, length histograms, and phylogeny.

                        <h5>Identification of RSS subgroups</h5>

                        <p class="font-weight-bold">
                        The size of the RSS requires a large-scale strategy for identifying subgroups with related 
                        functions, e.g., the segregation of the SSN as described in this section.  Given the large 
                        numbers of both starting sequences and clusters that are identified, we cannot guarantee 
                        that the segregation is "perfect".  Indeed, we expect that it is not.   However, the 
                        identified clusters provide manageable starting points for the discovery of novel functions 
                        using EFI-EST, EFI-GNT, and EFI-CGFP.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Following the strategy used by the SFLD, we segregated the SSN for the RSS into 
                        clusters, some SFLD-curated subgroups and others containing uncharacterized sequences.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        We generated the reference SSN for RadicalSAM.org using the 44,060 UniRef50 IDs with 
                        UniProt-defined "complete" sequences in families IPR007197 and IP006638 as defined 
                        by InterPro 78 (based on UniProt 2020_01).  
                        These UniRef50 clusters contain 544,274 UniProt IDs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        [According to UniProt, a "complete" sequence is encoded by a genomic sequence with 
                        both a start and stop codon; "fragments" are encoded by a genomic sequence missing 
                        one or both.  However, the "complete" sequences are not necessarily "full-length" 
                        functional proteins:  e.g., sequencing errors produce incorrect start/stop codons; 
                        also, a coding sequence at the end of a sequencing read may not include a start or 
                        stop codon.  Many "incomplete" proteins can be removed from an SSN using a minimum 
                        length filter, although "incomplete" proteins that exceed the minimum length filter 
                        will not be removed.  The "incomplete" proteins can influence the quality of a 
                        multiple sequence alignment, reducing the apparent percent conservation of conserved 
                        residues and the utility of the hidden Markov model (HMM) generated from the MSA.]

                        The SSN shown below was generated using a minimum edge alignment score of 11 to 
                        connect nodes; it contains 44,060 nodes and 36,371,317 edges.  The SSN was analyzed 
                        with a Mac Pro with 768GB RAM (significantly more RAM than available on typical 
                        computers).

                        In contrast to the SFLD's SSN (<i>vide supra</i>), the clusters containing the subgroups are not separated in 
                        this SSN (a single cluster!), the result of both the larger number of nodes and the choice of a 
                        smaller alignment score to both prevent splitting SFLD subgroups into multiple clusters and, 
                        also, reduce the number of singletons.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The clusters containing the SFLD subgroups were separated by manual deletion of "long" SSN edges 
                        ("remote" sequence relationships).   This editing is subjective, but we know of no other 
                        practical strategy to separate the subgroups.  That 1) the nodes associated with the various 
                        subgroups colocalize in the starting SSN and 2) their colocalization is maintained in the 
                        editing supports the validity of this approach.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        In several of the SFLD subgroups, some nodes are grey because they are not recognized by the 
                        HMMs used by the InterPro databases to identify family members (many of 
                        the HMMs were generated when the RSS was significantly smaller/less diverse). 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Also, the nodes associated with subgroup 5, B12-binding domain (blue nodes), and subgroup 17, 
                        SPASM/Twitch-domain (magenta magenta), are not colocalized in a single discrete cluster because 
                        the sequence-function space is more diverse than that for the other subgroups.  
                        </p>

                        The resulting SSN contained 15 clusters, including five "megaclusters" containing multiple SFLD 
                        subgroups [(mega)clusters are numbered in order of decreasing number of UniRef50 IDs/nodes].

                        <h5>Database Updates</h5>
                        
                        <p>
                        With the exception of subgroup 5, B12-binding domain, and subgroup 17, SPASM/Twitch-domain 
                        (<i>vide infra</i>), the sequences in the RadicalSAM.org clusters will be updated with each release 
                        of the InterPro and UniProt databases (every 8 weeks) using HMMs that were generated from the 
                        UniRef50 IDs in the clusters segregated in the SSN generated using UniProt 2020_02/InterPro 78.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The MSA was generated for each cluster using the node UniRef50 IDs.  The sequences were 
                        length-filtered to include only full-length single domain proteins (from inspection of the length 
                        histogram for the UniProt IDs); both short "incomplete" sequences that result from sequencing 
                        errors (vide supra) and multidomain proteins were excluded.  The length histograms for all UniProt 
                        IDs and the length-filtered UniRef50 IDs used to generate the MSA are provided for each cluster.  
                        The MSA was generated using MUSCLE.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The HMM was generated from the MSA using the hmmbuild utility of HMMER3
                        (<a target="_blank" href="http://hmmer.org/">http://hmmer.org/</a>).  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The HMMs and the hmmsearch utility of HMMER3 are used to identify the UniRef50 IDs for the 
                        clusters in each release of the UniProt/InterPro databases.  The sensitivity threshold for 
                        identifying a match is chosen to minimize false positives.   
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The UniRef50 IDs are expanded to identify the UniRef90 IDs using the cluster compositions provided 
                        by UniProt.  The UniRef90 IDs are similarly expanded to identify the UniProt IDs.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        N.B.:  The sequences identified as members of a cluster may not comprise the "true" number of 
                        sequences, i.e., the matches that are identified is determined by sensitivity threshold used with 
                        hmmsearch.  Therefore, matches may include false positives; also, the UniProt database may include 
                        true positives that contain the signature Cx<sub>3</sub>Cx<sub>2</sub>C motif but were not selected.  False positives 
                        can be identified as "outliers" in an SSN generated for the identified sequences.

                        <h6>What are HMMs?</h6>

                        <p>
                        Users of RadicalSAM.org may not be familiar with HMMs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Briefly, an HMM represents the consensus sequence for a set of homologous proteins; it provides 
                        the probability of each amino acid residue and, when appropriate, insertion at each position.  As 
                        described in the previous section, we generated the HMMs using the hmmbuild utility in HMMER3 from 
                        MSAs constructed with the UniRef50 IDs in the clusters. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The HMM is used to identify "hits" in the UniProt database using the hmmsearch utility in HMMER3.  
                        The thresholds" for matches were chosen to minimize false positives.  In practice, the thresholds 
                        were selected to reproduce the UniRef50 IDs in the clusters in the reference SSN for UniProt 
                        2020_02/InterPro 78.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The HMMs can be downloaded either as an image (png file) or a text file HMM that can viewed 
                        interactively using Skylign (<a target="_blank" href="https://skylign.org/">https://skylign.org/</a>).  The image 
                        provides a summary of the consensus sequence, with the caveat that the size of the residue symbol 
                        represents the probability of occurrence of the residue, not its percent conservation in the MSA.  
                        Insertions/deletions are represented a red vertical line in the image.   Viewing the HMM with 
                        Skylign provides access to the values of the residue and insertion probabilities at each position.

                        <p>
                        We would like RadicalSAM.org to be a community resource, with users providing current annotation 
                        information that will assist the community with selection of proteins for study and inform the 
                        sequence-function space that is used to infer functions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        SwissProt annotations are incomplete and sometimes vague or incorrect; experimentally verified 
                        annotations provided by the community are expected to be both more reliable and precise.  On the 
                        <a href="submit.html">Submit</a> page, we provide a "Community Annotation Submission" form for users to submit 
                        experimentally determined functions as well as publications that document/describe these 
                        functions.  After review, these will be  included on the cluster pages using the "Pubs" 
                        and "Anno" buttons.
